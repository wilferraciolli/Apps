# GO made right

Repository to teach GO lang


GO Lang is suppose to be similar to C but more modern and easy to use

code is structured within modules (packages)

### GO.work 
This file is what allow us to especify what the modules are exported/defined...
Note that this file is not commited as it is to manage dependencies locally, it is related to the workspace only and varies depending on the system running the code.
